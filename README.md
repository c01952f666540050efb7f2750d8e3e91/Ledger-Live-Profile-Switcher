# Ledger Live Profile Switcher

This is an experimental way to change the accounts that appear in Ledger Live.

Trying to follow the specs that are listed in this doc:
[https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live-common/blob/develop/docs/account.md]

The next thing would be to make sure this work as a standalone cli tool.

The next potential step after that would be to implement a minimal python web framework to run this in the browser.
